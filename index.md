I'm a Phd student in Economics at the University of Chicago.
My research is in econometrics. 

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.**

Broadly, my interests lie in decision making in the face of uncertainty.
Some of my work includes
experimental design,
treatment choice, 
and network models.

I enjoy applying tools from optimization and machine learning to solve 
econometric problems.
