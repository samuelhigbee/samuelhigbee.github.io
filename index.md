# Welcome!

I'm a Phd Student in Economics at the University of Chicago.  My research is in econometrics.

I'm especially interested in using data to solve decision problems in economic contexts, including treatment assignment, experimental design, and auction/market design.  I also study applications of optimal transport in econometrics and nonparametric modeling.

I'm an amateur musician who plays jazz (poorly) and folk (somewhat better), mostly on guitar but dabbling in other instruments.
