I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.

My research is in econometrics, 
and focuses on making economic policy decisions in the face of uncertainty. Â 
My work includes experimental design, 
analysis of treatment effect heterogeneity, 
and estimation of personalized treatment rules and optimal policies.
I enjoy applying tools from optimization and machine learning to solve
econometric problems.
