I'm a Phd student in Economics at the University of Chicago.
My research is in econometrics.

Broadly, my interests lie in decision making in the face of uncertainty.
Some of my work includes
experimental design,
treatment choice,
and network models.
I enjoy applying tools from optimization and machine learning to solve
econometric problems.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.**
A draft of my job market paper will be posted here soon.

My email is samuelhigbee at uchicago dot edu.
