I'm a Phd student in Economics at the University of Chicago.
My research is in econometrics.

Broadly, my interests lie in decision making in the face of uncertainty.
My work focuses on
experimental design and policy learning/treatment choice.
I enjoy applying tools from optimization and machine learning to solve
econometric problems.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.**
A draft of my job market paper will be posted here soon.

My email is samuelhigbee at uchicago dot edu.
