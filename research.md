**Policy Learning with New Treatments** [(pdf)]({{ site.url }}/assets/papers/policy_learning_new.pdf)

*Revision requested at Quantitative Economics*

I study the problem of a decision maker choosing a policy to allocate treatment to a 
heterogeneous population on the basis of experimental data that includes only a subset 
of possible treatment values.
The effects of new treatments are partially identified based on shape restrictions on 
treatment response.
I propose solving an empirical minimax regret problem to estimate the policy and show 
it has a tractable linear- and integer-programming formulation.
I prove the maximum regret of the estimator converges to the lowest possible maximum 
regret at the rate at which heterogeneous treatment effects can be estimated in the 
experimental data or N^(-1/2), whichever is slower.
I apply my results to design targeted subsidies for electrical grid connections in rural 
Kenya, and estimate that 97% of the population should be given a treatment not implemented 
in the experiment.
